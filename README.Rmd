# defense

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of defense is to implement the raster defensibility index as reported in Bocinsky 2014.

The package contains a function calculating the extrinsic defensibility for any position on a 30-meter DEM.

**NOTE: This has not been thoroughly tested, nor has it been generalized to DEMs of 
other resolutions. Mileage may vary.**

This defensibility index is a rasterization of one defined by Martindale and Supernant (2009):

## Installation

You can install the development version of defense from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bocinsky/defense")
```

## Example

The `defense` package includes a 30 m DEM of Mesa Verde National Park for testing. 
You might try to do something like this:

```{r example}
library(defense)

meve_di <-
  defense::meve %>%
  defense::di_calculate_defensibility_index()

raster::plot(meve_di$defensibility, zlim = c(0,1))

```
